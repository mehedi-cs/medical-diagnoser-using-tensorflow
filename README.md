# 🧠 Medical Diagnoser - Deep Learning Practice Project

This project builds a deep learning model to predict diseases and their corresponding prescriptions based on patients' symptoms.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding)
- Multi-output classification (disease & prescription)
- LSTM-based deep learning model
- Trained using real-world medical symptom data

## 📁 Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code modules
- `train.py`: Script to train the model
- `predict.py`: Script to make a prediction
- `models/`: Trained model files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks (optional)
- `data/`: (optional) contains the dataset

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Train the model
```bash
python train.py
